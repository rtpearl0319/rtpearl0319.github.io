  So here we go! I started this trip waking up an hour later than intended. Whoopsies! My friends (Amit,
  Karen, Josh, and Camden) kept me up late friday night with a going away party and homemade chicken korma!
  Golly was that delicious, no idea what you did Amit but you are truly a talented chef.
  <br><br>
  Saturday morning I slowly got out of my sleeping bag, brushed my teeth, put in my eyeballs, and
  began my journey to Denver, CO. 6 hours later, I made it to lunch at Coyote Bluff Cafe in Amarillo, TX.
  Yes, I drove 6 hours from Dallas, TX and I was still in Texas, what the heck. After a surprising juicy and tasty
  bacon cheeseburger, it was time to hop back in the car to finish the 2nd half of this 12 hour drive. Certainly not
  the greatest idea to have a heavy lunch and then sit in a car for 6 hours but somehow I survived and touched down
  in Littleton, CO. Unpacked my car, said hello to the owners of this rental, and proceeded to almost miss the bed
  passing out.
  <br><br>
  Sunday came around and my body decided to wake up at 6am so I went ahead and did the only smart thing I could think of!
  Lay in bed until 7am while watching YouTube videos. Finally, with a stomach growling at my decision, I got out of bed and
   traversed my way into my car and onto Littleton Cafe for breakfast. Honestly, decently surprised at the quality and
   tast of the food they served. Having a sunnyside-up egg on avocado toast and a side of biscuits and gravy got me ready
  for my next stop... THE GYM! Well, not the gym gym, but the climbing gym Movement Englewood. I was pretty excited to
  check this place out since I had heard so many good things about it. I was not disappointed! The gym was massive, bigger
  than any of the Movement's in Dallas (that's for sure!) and bouldered for about an hour. Man, that elevation is no joke!
  I was winded by the end of the session and went home, showered, and got ready for lunch! Brendon came over to Dallas and
  spent some time together, showing me around Denver and some parks in the city. After about 3 hours of walking around,
   it was time for us to head back to our respective homes and for me to actually go get groceries, so I don't spend
  everything eating out.
  <br><br>
  Oy vey, this week has kind of been a blur to say the least! Monday, started up, and my 6am alarm rudely awoke me just so I
  could hit snooze for a solid 15 more minutes of peace. After the alarm went off for the second time, I was seriously debating
  going for another 15. But alas! I found the strength to get out of bed, throw my glasses on, and sit down at my laptop for my
  first day of work in Denver. Things went smoothly, a rough 5 hour work day, such brutal hours to work. after work, I cooked some
  food, cleaned things around the studio, and proceeded to pass out.
  <br><br>
  Tuesday was a bit of a repeat, but I did get to go to the climbing gym again after work! This time, I found someone on the
  facebook group to Top Rope with. That's where you wear a harness and decide it's a brilliant idea to climb 60 feet up a wall,
  hopefully you really trust your partner and your equipment! We were able to climb for about 2 hours before calling it a day
  with our arms pumped and fingers unable to grip anything. Deciding it was time for dinner, we went to a local Chinese restaurant
  Wok Spicy in Englewood. Surprisingly delicious, they had incredible Sichuan Chili Wontons and a really great tasting Pork Belly Bao bun.
  We also ordered their Pork Belly Dry Wok which was good and had a nice spice level to it.

  Wednesday was a rainy day, it was hard getting out of bed, and especially out of the house. I ended up heading out to Copper Door Cafe to try for
  some fresh air. Worked a full 8 hours surprisingly, and on my way home it stopped raining! I was debating if I should go out and use my drone,
  maybe take some photos and videos since I haven't explored much. And after a great debate, we decided to walk up to Jackass Hill Park. No, I did
  not make that up, it's a beautiful name for a park... It was perfect weather for some photography and to test out the drone, very little wind, the clouds
  were incredible, and the sun rays shining through were brilliant! I took some videos, photos, and then headed off to the gym to workout.
  By the end of my workout, it was time to pass out... And thus came Thursday!
