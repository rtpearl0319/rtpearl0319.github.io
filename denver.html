  So here we go! I started this trip waking up an hour later than intended. Whoopsies! My friends (Amit,
  Karen, Josh, and Camden) kept me up late friday night with a going away party and homemade chicken korma!
  Golly was that delicious, no idea what you did Amit but you are truly a talented chef.

  Saturday morning (5/3/25) I slowly got out of my sleeping bag, brushed my teeth, put in my eyeballs, and
  began my journey to Denver, CO. 6 hours later, I made it to lunch at Coyote Bluff Cafe in Amarillo, TX.
  Yes, I drove 6 hours from Dallas, TX and I was still in Texas, what the heck. After a surprising juicy and tasty
  bacon cheeseburger, it was time to hop back in the car to finish the 2nd half of this 12 hour drive. Certainly not
  the greatest idea to have a heavy lunch and then sit in a car for 6 hours but somehow I survived and touched down
  in Littleton, CO. Unpacked my car, said hello to the owners of this rental, and proceeded to almost miss the bed
  passing out.

  Sunday came around and my body decided to wake up at 6am so I went ahead and did the only smart thing I could think of!
  Lay in bed until 7am while watching YouTube videos. Finally, with a stomach growling at my decision, I got out of bed and
   traversed my way into my car and onto Littleton Cafe for breakfast. Honestly, decently surprised at the quality and
   tast of the food they served. Having a sunnyside-up egg on avocado toast and a side of biscuits and gravy got me ready
  for my next stop... THE GYM! Well, not the gym gym, but the climbing gym Movement Englewood. I was pretty excited to
  check this place out since I had heard so many good things about it. I was not disappointed! The gym was massive, bigger
  than any of the Movement's in Dallas (that's for sure!) and bouldered for about an hour. Man, that elevation is no joke!
  I was winded by the end of the session and went home, showered, and got ready for lunch! Brendon came over to Dallas and
  spent some time together, showing me around Denver and some parks in the city. After about 3 hours of walking around,
   it was time for us to head back to our respective homes and for me to actually go get groceries so I don't spend
  everything eating out.
